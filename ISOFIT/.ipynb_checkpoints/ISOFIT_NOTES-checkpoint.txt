NOTES ON ISOFIT


isofit.core.common

	Class VectorInterpolator - untested

	def load_wavelen()- tested

	def emissive_radiance() - still having issues with testing

	def svd_inv() - still having issues with asserts in prelim_common.py

	def svd_inv_sqrt() - contains the actual matrix inversion - issues to be resolved

	def expand_path() - not robust, because forward slash specified and 
	lacking check of file existence; rewritten with initial check and using os.path.abspath

		- question about catching exceptions here

	def recursive_replace()- tested

	def get_absorption() - tested

	def recursive_reencode() - checked that function visits every place it intends to- unsure about expandvars()
	function designed to expand variables

	def json_load_ascii() - untested

	def expand_all_paths() - tested

	def find_header() - tested

	def resample_spectrum() - possibly an error in finding nearest good index

	def load_spectrum() - tested

	def spectral_response_function() - tested

	def combos() - tested

	def conditional_gaussian() - untested

	def envi_header() - unable to test because os.path.isfile() checks file system to see if files exist
